"""Marketplace LLM wiring — build the client per invocation, from ctx.secrets.

Two problems this solves, neither visible until the agent runs on the platform.

1. The runner constructs the graph as ``Graph()`` with no arguments
   (``marketplace_app.py:95``), so an injected ``llm_client`` is always ``None``
   there and every LLM-backed node takes its degradation branch. The run still
   reports ``status: success`` while producing placeholder content — which then
   passes whatever checks look at that content. The agent therefore has to build
   its own client.

2. Nodes call ``llm.generate(prompt)`` with a plain string. ``BaseLLM`` exposes
   ``complete(messages)`` taking a message list; ``.generate`` only resolves
   through ``AzureOpenAIClient.__getattr__`` down to LangChain's
   ``BaseChatModel.generate``, which expects ``list[list[BaseMessage]]`` and fails
   on a string. ``_GenerateAdapter`` bridges the two shapes so call sites keep the
   name they already use.

Build inside ``execute()``, never in ``__init__``: secrets are per-invocation, and
``compile()`` runs before the provider exists. Do not assign the client to ``self``
either — a node instance is shared across invocations, and some graphs fan out with
a ThreadPoolExecutor.
