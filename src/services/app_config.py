"""One reader for config/config.yaml. Byte-identical fleet-wide.

Two things this exists to prevent, both measured:

1. **A knob declared and never read.** `marketplace_app.py:95` is `agent = agent_cls()` --
   no config is passed, and the invoke path carries none either. The Dockerfile still
   copies `config/`, so every value in config.yaml is a promise the runtime never keeps
   unless something opens the file. Measured on another template: `grounding_threshold` stayed
   0.7 whatever the operator set. No gate caught it -- the file exists, the YAML parses,
   and the tests pass config in by hand.

2. **Paths resolved from the working directory.** The container runs from `/app`; pytest
   runs from wherever it was invoked. `Path("config/config.yaml")` therefore works in the
   image and silently returns {} in a test -- or the reverse. The path here is derived
   from `__file__`, so it is the same file in both.

Explicit config WINS OUTRIGHT -- the file is read only when the caller passed nothing.
A merge that used the file as a base made `{"agent": {"config": {}}}` -- what the
fail-closed tests pass -- inherit real values, and three tests quietly stopped testing
what they were written for. *Absent* and *deliberately empty* are different answers.
