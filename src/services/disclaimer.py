"""The liability trailer every answer carries — one mechanism, fleet-wide.

Rule (user, 2026-08-28): **every** output ends with a disclaimer. Not only the good
answers: a guidance message, a refusal, and an error all carry one too. An error is the
moment a reader is most likely to act on a half-answer, so it is the last place to drop
the notice.

Language follows the answer:

* answer written in English  -> English trailer
* answer written in Japanese -> Japanese trailer
* language undetermined, or the message is about bad/unreadable input -> **BOTH**

The bilingual case is not a fallback for laziness. When the agent could not read the
input, its language detection is at its least reliable, and guessing wrong hands the
reader a notice in a language they may not read on top of a request that already failed.

Keep this file byte-identical across repos (`shared-file-drift` watches it). What varies
per agent is the SCOPE line — what this particular output is and is not — passed in by
the caller. A generic "this is AI-generated" says nothing a reader can act on; the scope
line is where the agent states the decision it must not be used for.
