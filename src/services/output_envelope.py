"""The reply envelope every agent returns. Byte-identical fleet-wide.

Two tiers, and mixing them up breaks `deploy-stg` while making the chat look better:

    get_output() returns  -> a DICT. `BaseGraph.invoke()` hands it straight to the
                             Marketplace runner (`result.get("status")`,
                             `result.get("output")`) and to

                             the other.
    dict["output"]        -> a STR of Markdown. This is the only tier the chat reader sees.

What lives here is the part that does not vary: the trailer, the empty-message
short circuit, and the never-blank guarantee. What each repo supplies is its own
