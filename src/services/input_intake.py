"""Read a free-form message once: its language, the fields the agent needs, and whether
the request is something this agent can do.

One model call, not three. Language detection, field extraction and a scope opinion all
read the same sentence, and every template invokes on every request -- splitting them
triples latency and cost for nothing.

The division of labour is fixed and deliberate:

    the model READS          the agent DECIDES
    ---------------          -----------------
    what language this is    which of the declared languages to answer in
    which fields appear      whether those values are acceptable
    whether it fits          whether to refuse

The model widens what a user may TYPE. It never widens what the agent will DO. Every
value it returns is checked for membership in a set the template declares; anything else
is dropped, and the deterministic path decides instead. Three consequences worth naming:

* A suggestion is returned as an INDEX into the template's own capability list, never as
  free text, so the agent cannot offer work it does not do -- and an invented capability
  reads exactly as convincingly as a real one.
* ``out_of_scope`` needs TWO independent signals: the model says no AND the agent's own
  deterministic check says no. Measured on another template (2026-08-27), the model returned
  "no connector matches" for a valid Japanese request and again for a Vietnamese one; a
  model-only refusal would have turned both into a dead end with no way to appeal.
* When the model is unavailable the result still comes back, marked ``source="fallback"``,
  so a degraded run is visible in the trace instead of looking like a confident answer.

Call this from inside ``execute()``. Calling it earlier -- in a graph hook or before the
node's security gate -- sends raw input, PII included, to the model provider.

How to read it, in this order:

1. LANGUAGE. Decide which language the writer would want to READ, which is not always the
   script they typed. A question written in romanised Japanese wants Japanese. A question
   in a language the assistant does not have is answered in the default, so if the message
   is in none of {languages}, say "other" -- do not pick the nearest one.
2. FIELDS. Fill a field only from what the message actually says. Do not infer a value
   because it is the most common one, and do not translate a value into a listed one that
   the writer did not mean. Leave a field out when the message does not carry it: a
   missing field is recoverable downstream, a wrong one is not.
3. FIT. Ask whether this assistant, as described below, could serve the request as
   written. Say "unsure" rather than "no" when the request is adjacent to what it does --
   "no" is reserved for a request plainly about something else.

Reply with JSON only -- no prose, no code fence -- with exactly these keys:
  "language": one of {languages}, or "other"
  "fields": an object holding any of these keys you can fill: {fields}
  "fits": "yes", "no", or "unsure"
  "suggestion": a number from the capability list, or null

    * **What comes back.** ``complete()`` answers ``{"content": str, ...}``, so
      ``str(response)`` is a Python dict repr -- single quotes, parses as nothing.
    * **Argument shape.** A client may want a string where another wants a list; a
