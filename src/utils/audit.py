"""S-4 audit wrapper. Byte-identical in every template -- the id belongs in the events,
not in this file's header.

Prefers the platform audit logger; falls back to a stderr JSON-Lines record so audit is
never lost and never raises. Never logs raw PII values -- only structured, already-safe
fields.

Two failures this file exists to prevent, both measured on real repositories 2026-08-28,
both of which left every test green and every gate passing:

* **The wrong module name.** another template imported ``shared.utils.trace``, which has never
  existed -- the supported shim is ``shared.utils.audit_logger``. The import raised, a
  broad ``except`` caught it, and all 36 call sites in the agent wrote to stderr instead.
  Verified by attaching a handler to ``agentcore.audit``: it received nothing.
* **A short call, or a None state.** The platform function takes
  ``(event_type, payload, state)`` and reads ``state.get(...)``. Passing two arguments,
  or passing ``None`` through, raises straight into the same broad ``except`` -- the
  events are dropped exactly as if the module were missing.

stderr is not equivalent to the logger. The platform record carries ``trace_id``,
``correlation_id`` and ``session_id`` read from state; those are what tie an audit line
back to the request that produced it and what the platform ships to its aggregator.
Without them there are logs, but not evidence.

"Best-effort / never raises" must NOT mean "swallow silently": a dropped audit event is
itself the security finding (ESC-FIN-028-029-S4). Every failure is therefore marked with
``audit_degraded`` on the fallback record, with exactly one quiet case -- the platform
logger module being absent, which is the expected the stub harness-vs-wheel difference and not a
defect.
